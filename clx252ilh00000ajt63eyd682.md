Today, a friend sent me a message with a screenshot from GitHub. It showed my name, Ali Tavallaie, listed as a contributor to the Taiga project. Seeing my name there was a surprise and made me feel proud. My friend’s message made me realize that my contribution, even though it wasn’t coding, was important.

I discovered Taiga, an open source project management tool, while browsing GitHub in 2019. As someone who enjoys open source, I’m always looking for ways to help out. I noticed that Taiga lacked a Persian translation. Although my main work involves coding, I saw this as a chance to contribute in a different way. **I reached out to the Taiga team, offering to translate the project into Persian, and they welcomed my help.**

The task of translating Taiga was challenging. I needed to understand the software well and ensure that the translations were accurate and clear. It wasn’t just about converting words from English to Persian; it was about making sure the translation was contextually appropriate and easy to understand for Persian-speaking users. **I worked on translating the interface and documentation, though I didn’t complete the entire translation.**

My translation work helped Persian-speaking users access and use Taiga more easily. **I tried to make it easier for everyone** who preferred to use software in Persian. It felt good to know that my effort could help others, even in a small way.

Seeing my name listed with other contributors like Amirhoshang Hoseinpour Dehkordi and Vahid Dayyani was heartwarming. ***It showed that contributions to open source come in many forms, not just coding***. Translating, writing documentation, and other tasks are all important.

Working on Taiga taught me that open source projects need various skills. Writing, translating, designing, and testing are all crucial. Every contribution, big or small, helps make the project better and more accessible.

I want to encourage everyone to contribute to open source projects, even if you don’t write code. Open source is not just about programming; it's about creating a community where everyone’s skills are valued. Your skills, whether in translating, writing, designing, or testing, are valuable and can make a huge difference. Translating helps break down language barriers and makes the software accessible to more people. Writing documentation ensures that users and developers can understand and use the software effectively. Designing improves the user interface and experience, making the software more intuitive and user-friendly. Testing helps find and fix bugs, ensuring that the software works well for everyone.

Open source projects thrive on the diversity of contributions from many different people. Each contribution, no matter how small, helps to build and improve the project. By contributing your unique skills, you help create a richer, more inclusive community. Your efforts can inspire others to join in and contribute their skills as well. So, don’t hesitate to get involved. Your contributions are needed and appreciated. Together, we can make a significant impact and create something truly amazing.

Reflecting on my work with Taiga, I feel proud to be part of a community that values all kinds of contributions. My experience shows that open source is about more than just coding. It’s about collaboration and making technology better for everyone.

So, if you’re interested in an open source project, don’t hesitate to contribute. **Your skills and efforts are needed and appreciated.** You can make a difference, just like I did.

Remember, in the world of open source, every contribution matters. Together, we can create amazing things.
