Hello everyone,

I hope you are doing well. I want to share some important news with you. I am nominating myself for the position of Director on the Board of the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

## My Statement

Here is my official statement for the PSF Board of Directors nomination:

---

I am honored to nominate myself for the position of Director on the Board of the Python Software Foundation (PSF). With extensive experience in Python development and a deep commitment to community engagement, I believe I can contribute significantly to the Foundation’s mission.

### Background and Experience

I have been an active member of the Python community for over a decade, with experience ranging from standalone applications to backend systems and AI solutions. For the past few years, I have served as one of the managing committee members of TehPug, where I have been involved in organizing and supporting various Python-related activities. You can view my contributions on the [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/AliTavallaie).

My daily work involves using Python, and I have hosted numerous talks, meetups, and workshops aimed at empowering non-programmers, such as non-CS students, and professionals in finance and accounting,Mechanical enginners, to use Python for automating repetitive tasks. These efforts not only expand the reach of Python but also equip individuals with valuable skills.

### Statement of Concerns

My primary motivation for seeking a position on the PSF Board of Directors is to bring attention to the challenges faced by underrepresented and underserved communities within the Python ecosystem.

1. **Access to Education**: There are significant barriers to education for girls in Afghanistan. The denial of educational opportunities for these girls is a grave concern that needs to be addressed.
    
2. **Internet Access**: In countries like Iran, many people do not have reliable internet access, which severely limits their ability to learn and contribute to the Python community.
    
3. **Support for Persian-speaking Communities**: There is a notable absence of PyLadies chapters and Python support for Persian-speaking girls in Iran, Afghanistan, and other Persian-speaking countries.
    
4. **Community Building in Arabic-speaking Countries**: Even in relatively stable countries like Oman, there is a lack of a strong Python community, which I believe is partly due to cultural barriers.
    

### Commitment to Advocacy

My candidacy is driven by a commitment to tell the stories of these underserved communities. It is not about whether I am elected or not; what is important is that the voices of these communities are heard. I want to highlight the impact that strong, inclusive communities can have in enabling individuals to find new opportunities and overcome societal barriers.

### Conclusion

I am excited about the possibility of serving on the PSF Board of Directors and contributing to the Foundation’s efforts to create a more inclusive and supportive Python community. Thank you for considering my nomination.

## OFAC License Application

I also want to share that I have applied for an OFAC license. This license will allow me to organize technology conferences, meetups, workshops, and other non-academic educational activities in countries with restrictions. However, I have not yet received an answer from OFAC.

Thank you for reading. Let's work together to make the Python community better for everyone.

Best regards
